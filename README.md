## 🚀 Features & What They Do

### 1. **Add Task**
- Adds a new task to the list
- ❗ If you add the same task twice, it will appear twice

### 2. **Show All Tasks**
- Displays every task, numbered from 1
- ✅ Completed tasks are shown with a ✅ in front
- 🛑 If the list is empty, it shows “No tasks available”

### 3. **Mark Task as Done**
- You must type the task **exactly** as it appears (case sensitive)
- If found, ✅ is added to the front of it
- If already marked, it says so
- If the task isn't found, it says “Task not found or already marked”

### 4. **Delete Task**
- Deletes a task by number (starting from 1)
- ❗ If you enter an invalid number, it shows an error
- ❗ If you enter letters or symbols, it says “Please enter a valid number”

### 5. **Show Pending Tasks**
- Only shows tasks **without** a ✅ in front
- If all tasks are done, says “No pending tasks”

### 6. **Exit**
- Ends the loop and closes the program
